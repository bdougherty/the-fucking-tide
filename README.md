# The Fucking Tide

> Check the fucking tide.

Inspired by [The Fucking Weather](http://thefuckingweather.com). Uses the [tides.app API](https://github.com/bdougherty/tide-predictions-graphql).

## Set up your own fucking tide site

```bash
npx degit bdougherty/the-fucking-tide my-fucking-app
cd my-fucking-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

You’ll also need to set up your own instance of the API. See [the readme](https://github.com/bdougherty/tide-predictions-graphql#usage) for instructions.
